Basic Reinforcement Learning (RL)
============================

This repository aims to provide an introduction series to reinforcement learning (RL) by delivering a walkthough on how to code different RL techniques.

- Tutorial 1: [Q-learning](tutorial1/README.md)
- Tutorial 2: [SARSA](tutorial2/README.md)
- Tutorial 3: [Exploring OpenAI gym](tutorial3/README.md)
- Tutorial 4: [Q-learning in OpenAI gym](tutorial4/README.md)
- Tutorial 5: [Deep Q-learning (DQN)](tutorial5/README.md)
