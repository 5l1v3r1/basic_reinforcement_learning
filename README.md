Basic Reinforcement Learning (RL)
============================

This repository aims to provide an introduction series to reinforcement learning (RL) by delivering a walkthough on how to code different RL techniques. The code will be building upon a cat-mouse-cheese discrete 2D world where the cat tries to catch the mouse while this one tries fo feed himself. Reinforcement learning will be used to create a mouse player.

*The cat is represented in orange, the mouse in grey and the cheese in yellow.*

### Tutorials:
- Tutorial 1: [Q-learning](tutorial1/README.md)
